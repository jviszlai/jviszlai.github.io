The HackPack is a project I worked on with 2 friends based around the idea of a "smart" backpack. The general idea was implemented as a wireless locking mechanism controlled from an android-based mobile device, meant to protect personal belongings.

I developed the android mobile application to control the backpack wirelessly, using Java in conjuction with Android Studio. The wireless communications function through the use of bluetooth, and control the backpack by sending commands to an arduino wired to a bluetooth reciever and two solenoids that act as the locks.

The code for the project can be found on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/jviszlai/HackPack-Android-App)

Below, I've also included a short demo of the project:
