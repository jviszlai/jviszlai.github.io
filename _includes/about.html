    Hi! I'm Joshua Viszlai, a fourth year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Physics at Georgia Tech. 
    My current interests are in Compilers, Computer Architecture, Quantum Computing, and Robotics. This website is an ongoing project of mine, 
    so I'm still working on moving my past experiences and projects onto it!
