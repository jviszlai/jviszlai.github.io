Hello! I'm Joshua Viszlai, a third year computer science and physics student at Georgia Tech. My interests include machine learning, robotics, and systems and architecture, but I'm looking to get experience in numerous other areas of software engineering.

I've worked with various programming languages mainly including Java, Python, and C, but I've also done projects with HTML, CSS, C++, Swift, and Objective-C. Thanks to my experience with robotics, I've also worked with electronics to integrate my code with hardware components.

I currently work as a TA for CS 2110 - Computer Organization and Programming, which is a introductory course to lower level programming. We cover topics such as binary operators, digital logic, the LC3 datapath and assembly, gameboy development in C, and dynamic memory allocation in C with malloc.

I'm also involved with Georgia Tech's RoboJackets in mentoring a high school robotics team, and in the past I've lead my high school robotics programming team where I was able to work on various projects, including [vision processing](/Automated-Vision-Processing), to aid in autonomous functions.

As a student, I'm looking to get my hands dirty with any project that can teach me more about the prospects of computer science and software engineering, and allow me to explore specific areas of the field that I might become interested in pursuing after school.
