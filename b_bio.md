Hello! I'm Joshua Viszlai, a first year computer science and physics student at Georgia Tech. My interests include robotics and mobile app development, but I'm looking to get experience in numerous areas of software engineering. Outside of computer science, I'm a physics lover and an avid video gamer with friends.

My work has been primarily with Java, but I've also done projects with Python, HTML, and CSS. Thanks to my experience with robotics, I've also worked with electronics to integrate my code with hardware components.

I'm currently involved with Georgia Tech's RoboJackets in mentoring a high school robotics team, and in the past I've lead my high school robotics programming team where I was able to work on various projects, including [vision processing](/Automated-Vision-Processing), to aid in autonomous functions.

As a student, I'm looking to get my hands dirty with any project that can teach me more about the prospects of computer science and software engineering, and allow me to explore specific areas of the field that I might become interested in pursuing after school.
